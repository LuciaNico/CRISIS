The CRISIS questionnaires were developed through a collaborative effort
between the research teams of Kathleen Merikangas and Argyris Stringaris
at the National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research Program
Mood Spectrum Collaboration, and those of Michael P. Milham at the Child
Mind Institute and the NYS Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric
Research.

**The CRISIS interview** has three versions:

the first administration and the Follow up form that should be done
